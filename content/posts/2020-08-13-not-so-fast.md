So â€“ I _finally_ finished rewriting all the low level code for [my app](https://github.com/yringler/inside-app), and Iâ€™m quite proud of it, actually. It was a [big](https://github.com/yringler/inside-api) [deal](https://github.com/yringler/just_audio_service). And now itâ€™s time for some [UI stuff](https://github.com/yringler/inside-app/pull/72)!

I cranked up my trusty olâ€™ [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), opened up my flutter app code, some [basic documentation](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/BottomNavigationBar-class.html), and started coding furiously.

After only a few minutes (really), I realized that I had no clue what I was doing. Which was a shocker â€“ well, maybe not _that_ much of a shocker, being that I had never learned what I was trying to do. But there was so much that I _did_ know how to do! And I had just finished some Really Hard Stuff â„¢! Doesnâ€™t that mean that [everything I touch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midas#Golden_Touch) until the end of time will turn to gold?

Turns out â€“ no, actually. It was time to [hit the books](https://randomthoughtsofyehuda.wordpress.com/2020/08/12/flutter-navigation/). And itâ€™s not easy. Itâ€™s a lot of new information and methodologies, and I already have a nice sized app which now has to be modified to fit in. It requires a deep, holistic understanding of what my app code is trying to do, and how the system Iâ€™m trying to integrate with works.

Sometimes you hit a wall, and you can either retreat to safe ground or push your limits and keep growing. Being a good programmer, or a good anything, means recognizing youâ€™re never so good that you canâ€™t get better, and never so experienced that you canâ€™t be a humble student.
