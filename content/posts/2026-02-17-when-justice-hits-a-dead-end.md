On March 16, 2024, Mary Fong Lau drove her Mercedes SUV at 70 miles per hour—the wrong way down a residential San Francisco street. She killed an entire family: Diego Cardoso de Oliveira (40), his wife Matilde Moncada Ramos Pinto (38), and their two infant sons, ages one and two months. They were waiting for a bus to the zoo.

Last week, Lau pleaded no contest. The judge indicated she'll receive probation. No prison time.

## The Legal Gymnastics

Lau's strategy was textbook asset protection:

1. **Immediately after the crash**: Transfer millions in real estate into a new LLC; sell other properties to family members
2. **Plead no contest instead of guilty**: Avoid creating evidence for civil lawsuits
3. **Accept conviction without admission**: Get sentenced while preserving deniability
4. **Let age and "remorse" do the work**: Judge decides 80-year-old dying in prison isn't proportional

The prosecutor objected. Victims' families are "appalled." But it worked.

## Why No Contest Matters

When you plead **guilty**, you admit you committed the crime. That admission becomes evidence in civil court—devastating for wrongful death lawsuits.

When you plead **no contest**, you accept punishment without admitting anything. The criminal case resolves, but victims' families must independently prove every element of negligence in civil court. No shortcuts. No smoking gun admission.

For someone who transferred assets into LLCs immediately after killing four people, this isn't about remorse. It's about limiting liability.

## The Outcome-Based Punishment Contradiction

Our legal system has a schizophrenic relationship with outcomes:

- **Murder vs. attempted murder**: Same intent, same action, different result (victim lives or dies). Radically different sentences—potentially life vs. 5-10 years.
- **DUI vs. DUI causing death**: Same drunk driving, different luck. 6 months vs. 15+ years.
- **Assault severity**: Same punch, different injury based on where victim falls. Different charges entirely.

**The system already punishes outcomes, not just intent.**

But when it comes to the ultimate punishment—death penalty or life without parole for extreme negligence—courts suddenly claim: "We only punish mental state, not results."[^1]

This is incoherent. If murder and attempted murder can differ by decades based purely on whether the victim survived, why can't extreme negligence that kills four people warrant life imprisonment?

## The Constitutional Barrier

The Supreme Court has held that capital punishment requires intent to kill or "depraved indifference" so extreme it approximates intent. Negligence—even gross negligence—doesn't qualify.

But **life without parole** isn't constitutionally barred for negligence. The barrier is legislative, not constitutional.

States could enact outcome-enhanced sentencing:

- Extreme negligence (wrong-way, high speed) + 1 death = 15-25 years
- Same negligence + 2+ deaths = 30 years to life
- Same negligence + 4+ deaths = life without parole

This mirrors the existing murder/attempted murder framework. It's constitutionally sound. It just requires political will.

## The "Depraved Indifference" Gap

Driving 70 mph the wrong way through a residential neighborhood *should* qualify as depraved indifference—conscious disregard of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that demonstrates extreme indifference to human life.

But prosecutors routinely undercharge these cases:

- **Depraved indifference murder**: 25-to-life, harder to prove
- **Vehicular manslaughter**: 10-20 years, slam dunk conviction

Prosecutors take the easy win. Defendants take the plea deal. Families get no justice.

## What Needs to Change

### 1. Mandatory Charging Standards
Specific scenarios should trigger mandatory depraved indifference charges:
- Wrong-way highway driving above 60 mph
- Street racing resulting in death
- DUI with prior convictions resulting in death

Remove prosecutorial discretion to plea down to manslaughter.

### 2. Catastrophic Outcome Enhancements
Multiple deaths should dramatically increase sentencing:
- Current: Most states treat 1 death vs. 4 deaths identically (concurrent sentences)
- Proposed: 2+ deaths triggers mandatory 30-years-to-life; 4+ deaths triggers life without parole

### 3. Close the No Contest Loophole
For vehicular homicide cases, no contest pleas should require:
- Judicial finding that defendant lacks resources warranting civil protection, OR
- Waiver of statute of limitations on civil claims, OR
- Prohibition entirely for cases involving 2+ deaths

### 4. Age Shouldn't Trump Body Count
"She'd die in prison" is a reason to avoid incarcerating 80-year-old shoplifters. It's not a reason to give probation to someone who killed four people through extreme recklessness.

If you're too old to survive prison, you're too old to drive 70 mph the wrong way.

## The Broader Pattern

The Lau case isn't an outlier. It's emblematic of a two-tier justice system where wealth fundamentally alters outcomes in vehicular homicide cases.

### Case Study: The "Affluenza Teen"

Ethan Couch killed four people in 2013 while driving drunk at age 16, with a blood alcohol level three times the legal limit.[^2] Prosecutors sought 20 years. His defense introduced the term "affluenza" — arguing his wealthy upbringing left him unable to understand consequences. Judge Jean Hudson Boyd sentenced him to 10 years probation and therapy at an upscale facility.

When he violated probation by fleeing to Mexico, he was sentenced to 720 days in jail — 180 days for each victim. Total time served for killing four people and paralyzing another: under two years.

His probation ended in 2023. Ethan Couch is a free man.

### Case Study: Rebecca Grossman

Rebecca Grossman, co-founder of the Grossman Burn Foundation, drove 73 mph through a marked crosswalk in Westlake Village in 2020, killing brothers Mark (11) and Jacob (8) Iskander.[^3] She fled the scene.

Unlike Lau and Couch, Grossman was actually convicted of second-degree murder — a rarity in vehicular homicide cases. Prosecutors sought 34 years to life. The judge sentenced her to 15 years to life, citing her lack of criminal record and "history of philanthropic activity," saying "She's not a monster as the prosecution attempts to portray her here."

She's eligible for parole in 2033 — potentially serving 7 years for two murders.

The judge's reasoning? Her wealth-funded philanthropy and clean record warranted leniency.

### The Mechanics of Inequality

This pattern repeats across jurisdictions:

**Immediate asset protection**: Wealthy defendants transfer property into LLCs, sell to family members, restructure holdings — sometimes within days of crashes. This isn't criminal; it's estate planning expertise that costs six figures and requires sophisticated legal teams most defendants can't afford.

**Elite legal representation**: Couch's family paid for expert psychologists who invented novel defenses. Grossman's defense team blamed her ex-boyfriend and argued the victims were "out of the crosswalk." These strategies require resources: expert witnesses ($10,000-50,000 per trial), private investigators, jury consultants, media management.

**Sentencing theater**: Judges consistently cite "lack of criminal record" and "community ties" as mitigating factors. Judge Brandolino noted Grossman "has engaged in philanthropy and demonstrated generosity," as if charitable foundations funded by family wealth should offset killing two children.

**The plea bargain advantage**: No contest pleas preserve civil defense options. Wealthy defendants can afford the parallel civil litigation; poor defendants take guilty pleas for immediate sentence reductions because they can't fight on two fronts.

**The data bears this out**: Studies show vehicular homicide sentencing varies wildly based on defendant resources, not harm caused.[^4] Sentences for killing one person range from probation to 20+ years, with wealth and race as stronger predictors than blood alcohol level or speed.

## The Legal Framework Already Exists

**This is what makes vehicular homicide unique:** The law already recognizes cars as deadly weapons and extreme reckless driving as potentially murderous conduct.

California courts established in *People v. Aguilar* (1997) that a car qualifies as a deadly weapon when "used in a way to cause substantial, significant or great bodily injury or death."[^5] Minnesota's Supreme Court ruled in 2024 that cars driven recklessly are "dangerous weapons" when operated in a manner "likely to produce death or great bodily harm."[^6]

Courts routinely uphold assault with a deadly weapon charges for intentional vehicle attacks. The legal principle is settled.

Under "implied malice" or "depraved heart" murder doctrines, second-degree murder doesn't require intent to kill. It requires conduct showing "conscious disregard for human life" or an "abandoned and malignant heart."[^7]

The classic historical example: firing a gun into a crowd. You didn't aim at anyone specifically, but you created obvious lethal risk and fired anyway. Courts in the 1800s called this depraved heart murder because "firing weapons into assemblies" demonstrated extreme indifference to human life.

**Driving 70 mph the wrong way down a residential street is functionally identical.** You're propelling a 4,000-pound deadly weapon at lethal velocity into occupied space. The mental state is the same: conscious disregard for near-certain death.

But look at the charging decisions:

- **Rebecca Grossman**: Actually charged with second-degree murder (rare). Still got less than half the requested sentence.
- **Mary Fong Lau**: Vehicular manslaughter. 70 mph wrong way, 4 deaths = probation.
- **Ethan Couch**: Intoxication manslaughter. BAC 0.24, 70 mph in 40 zone, 4 deaths = probation.

The legal framework exists. Prosecutors choose not to use it, opting for easy manslaughter convictions over harder-to-prove murder charges.

## The Sister's Words

Denise Oliveira, sister of Diego Cardoso de Oliveira, said it best: "It feels like we have no rights. I feel deeply disrespected by this process. It doesn't feel like justice."

She's right. It isn't.

**Update**: Lau's formal sentencing is scheduled for March 2026. Victims' families continue to pursue civil litigation against shielded assets.

[^1]: The principle derives from Supreme Court jurisprudence limiting capital punishment to crimes involving intent to kill. See [*Enmund v. Florida*, 458 U.S. 782 (1982)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/458/782/) (death penalty unconstitutional for felony murder participants who didn't kill, intend to kill, or anticipate lethal force); [*Coker v. Georgia*, 433 U.S. 584 (1977)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/433/584/) (death penalty unconstitutional for rape where victim survives); [*Kennedy v. Louisiana*, 554 U.S. 407 (2008)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/554/407/) (death penalty unconstitutional even for child rape if victim survives). Courts consistently hold that punishment severity must be proportional to *culpability* (mental state), not just *harm* (outcomes).

[^4]: Vehicular homicide sentencing varies wildly across jurisdictions and cases. Sentences range from probation to 30+ years for similar conduct depending on state, prosecutorial charging decisions, and defendant resources. A Dartmouth/Harvard study found that vehicular homicide defendants receive shorter sentences on average than other homicide offenders, with race and victim identity as stronger predictors of sentence length than offense severity. See [Wikipedia: Vehicular Homicide (citing Dartmouth/Harvard study)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicular_homicide); state sentencing variations documented in [Justia: Vehicular Homicide Laws](https://www.justia.com/criminal/offenses/homicide/vehicular-homicide/). The extreme variation in sentences for similar conduct—one defendant receiving 10-20 years while another receives probation—is well-documented across jurisdictions. [H.

This mental state doesn't require intent to kill—it can be inferred from conduct so reckless it demonstrates extreme indifference to whether death results.
