A dozen times a day
I say your name is great
And holy
I see their faces.  
The world is as you will  
I know you are the king  
So why  
Do I shake with their fear?  
  
Where is salvation  
Where is Messiah  
In our life  
And in the days  
Of all of your children  
Is your name so great?  
And still  
  
A dozen times a day  
I say your great name  
Is blessed  
For ever and ever  
And ever.  
Where is the praise  
The beauty and the splendor  
Thick stench  
Coarse hands  
A shattered world.  
Is your name still higher  
than every comfort?  
  
I know you are our father  
I know you are the fire  
In the thorns  
Their pain and blood is yours.  
But we are so small  
Bring your peace in heaven  
here
