# The Force Is a Religion: Why Modern Star Wars Can't Find Its Soul

There's a persistent mystery in contemporary pop culture: why can't the most valuable intellectual property in entertainment history recapture its magic? Disney has poured billions into Star Wars, hired talented filmmakers, and produced technically proficient content—yet something essential keeps slipping through their fingers. The sequel trilogy divided the fanbase. Solo flopped. The streaming shows range from "pretty good" to "forgettable." Meanwhile, the original and prequel trilogies, for all their flaws, continue to resonate across generations.

The standard explanations—bad writing, corporate interference, lack of planning—have merit but miss something deeper. The problem isn't execution. It's cosmology.

## Lucas Was Building a Religion

George Lucas was explicit about what he was doing. In his famous conversations with Bill Moyers, he described consciously setting out to "recreate myths and the classic mythological motifs," drawing on Joseph Campbell's comparative mythology to distill ideas that "cut across the most cultures." The result was a deliberate syncretism: Zen Buddhism's mindfulness, Taoism's cosmic balance, Christianity's redemption narrative, Zoroastrian dualism, the Campbellian monomyth. Lucas called "Use the Force" a "leap of faith"—trusting in "mysteries and powers larger than we are."

This wasn't mere aesthetic borrowing. Lucas understood he was filling a cultural vacuum. In a secularizing age, young people had lost access to the fairy tales, myths, and religious narratives that had transmitted moral frameworks for millennia. Star Wars was designed to be a delivery mechanism for those frameworks in a form modern audiences could absorb.

The result resonated instantly and profoundly—not because of special effects or space battles, but because it connected audiences to something they recognized in their bones. The hero's journey. The struggle between light and darkness. Redemption through love and sacrifice. These patterns have been nurturing human civilization since before recorded history. Lucas plugged directly into that current.

## The Moral Architecture of the Original Trilogy

The original Star Wars films are often described as having "simple" or "black and white" morality. This is both true and misleading.

Yes, the Empire is evil. Yes, the Rebels are good. Vader wears black; Leia wears white. The visual grammar is unsubtle. But within this clear framework, the actual characters are remarkably complex.

Han Solo is a mercenary who initially helps only for money. "I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid." Lando Calrissian betrays his friends to the Empire. Obi-Wan Kenobi lies to Luke about his father. Even Luke faces genuine temptation in the Emperor's throne room—the possibility of falling is real, and we feel it.

The crucial distinction: the *characters* are gray, but the *framework* is not. Han's selfishness is genuinely selfish. Lando's betrayal is genuinely a betrayal. When Luke throws away his lightsaber and refuses to kill his father, he's right—and the film treats him as right, not as naive. The Light Side and Dark Side are ontologically real within the story's universe. Characters struggle to navigate them, sometimes fail, sometimes rise—but the categories themselves are never in question.

This mirrors how traditional religious frameworks actually operate. Judaism, Christianity, Buddhism, Islam—all present clear categories of virtue and vice, yet the entire drama of human existence lies in the struggle between them. The categories aren't simplistic; they're load-bearing. Remove them and the struggle becomes meaningless.

## The Prequel Critique—Within the Framework

The prequel trilogy is often cited as evidence that Lucas himself deconstructed the Jedi. After all:

- The Jedi are shown as arrogant and institutionally blind
- "Heroes on both sides" appears in the Revenge of the Sith crawl
- Mace Windu attempts extrajudicial execution
- The Jedi use a slave army without apparent moral concern
- Dooku's critique of the Republic has genuine merit
- Qui-Gon defies the Council and is framed as correct

All true. But note what Lucas is doing: he's showing *flawed people and institutions failing to live up to a real moral order*. The Jedi's failures don't vindicate the Sith. They make the tragedy *deeper*—these people had access to genuine truth and fumbled it through pride and rigidity.

Anakin's fall is staged as horror. The music swells with grief. He murders children. We are not supposed to think "well, he had good reasons" or "the Jedi kind of had it coming." The fall has *weight* precisely because the Light Side is genuinely good and Anakin is genuinely betraying it.

The critique is: "the Jedi failed to live up to their own correct ideals." Not: "the Jedi's ideals were wrong."

This is the difference between prophetic critique and deconstruction. The Hebrew prophets excoriated Israel for failing to keep the covenant—but their critique only makes sense because the covenant is real and binding. Lucas critiques the Jedi the way Jeremiah critiques the priests: from within a framework that validates the thing being critiqued.

## The Post-Religious Turn

Now compare to the Disney era's characteristic moves.

Kylo Ren is introduced feeling "the pull to the light" before we've seen him be genuinely evil. He kills Han Solo, but the scene is staged as tragic rather than wicked—Han reaching for his face, the mournful lighting. His turn to the Dark Side is retroactively framed as Luke's fault (Luke almost murdered him in his sleep). Supplementary material eventually suggested Kylo "was never truly evil in the first place"—Palpatine destroyed Luke's temple and let Ben take the blame.

The filmmakers kept Kylo's hands clean in The Rise of Skywalker specifically to enable his redemption, introducing a new villain to do the actual villainy. They wanted the audience to root for redemption before he'd done anything requiring genuine redemption.

Contrast with Vader: we *see* him torture Leia, murder Obi-Wan, freeze Han, sever his son's hand. The redemption in Return of the Jedi lands because we've witnessed genuine evil. The turn is miraculous—the triumph of a buried remnant of good against overwhelming darkness. Kylo is presented as an abuse victim the entire time.

Or consider Baylan Skoll from Ahsoka. The show's director explicitly stated: "The idea that he was evil or a bad guy was never part of the discussion." Dave Filoni and Ray Stevenson debated this on set—Filoni would say "Ray, you're the villain here," and Stevenson would respond "I don't think so." Baylan is positioned as having a "different perspective," not as being wrong.

When Baylan says "I miss the idea of the Jedi... but not the truth, the weakness," he's framing the Jedi ideal itself as the problem, not the failure to embody it. This is deconstruction, not prophetic critique.

Andor—widely praised as the best Disney-era Star Wars—explicitly positions itself as showing that "significant change is driven by collective action and morally ambiguous choices, rather than by singular, preordained heroes guided by a metaphysical Force." That's not a critique of characters within the mythic framework. That's a critique of the framework itself.

The show's protagonist Cassian Andor opens Rogue One by murdering an ally—shooting an informant in the back after telling him "everything was going to be okay." The series Andor doubles down: Luthen Rael sacrifices entire rebel cells and murders his own loyal operatives. Mon Mothma is pushed into ethically compromising decisions. Even Imperial villains are given "understandable" motivations.

The framing presents this as mature, realistic, sophisticated. War is complicated. Everyone has reasons. The Rebellion isn't really better than the Empire—they're both buying weapons from the same manufacturers.

This is what storytelling looks like when the underlying assumption is that moral categories are *constructed* rather than *discovered*—products of culture, power, and perspective rather than features of reality.

## The Exception Proves the Rule

The Mandalorian Season 1 was a genuine cultural event. Grogu became the biggest pop culture phenomenon Star Wars had produced since the original trilogy. It unified a fractured fanbase, saved Disney+ subscriptions, and launched a merchandising bonanza.

Look at what it did structurally:

- Imperials hunting a baby to exploit his blood = unambiguous evil
- Protecting an innocent child = unambiguous good
- Din Djarin's profession is morally gray, but the *stakes* are crystal clear

Nobody asks "but were the Imperials really wrong to want Grogu's blood?" Nobody frames Moff Gideon as "having a point." The Client is sinister from frame one—no sympathetic backstory about his difficult childhood.

Din's internal struggle is real: his creed says complete the bounty; his conscience says this is wrong. But the moral framework isn't questioned—his conflict is whether he'll live up to it.

It's a Western. It's Lone Wolf and Cub. It's every protective father archetype humans have told stories about for millennia. Lucas's insight executed perfectly: a morally complex *protagonist* navigating a morally clear *universe*.

Then later seasons drifted toward lore management and crossover setup, and some of that resonance faded. But Season 1 proves the formula still works when you trust it.

## Post-Religious Storytelling

The pattern across Disney-era Star Wars reflects a broader cultural shift in how stories approach morality.

In a religious framework—whether the explicit traditions Lucas drew from or the implicit "moral realism" of most pre-modern storytelling—good and evil exist prior to human opinion about them. They're features of reality to be discovered, not positions to be constructed. The drama lies in how characters navigate, struggle with, fail at, and sometimes rise to meet that preexisting moral order.

In a post-religious framework, moral categories are constructed—products of culture, power, perspective. "Good" and "evil" are labels applied by those with the power to define them. If this is your operating assumption, then:

- Portraying clear evil feels naive or propagandistic
- Portraying clear good feels preachy or simplistic
- The sophisticated move is to show "complexity"—that everyone has reasons, that institutions are the real problem, that it's all perspective

This produces exactly what we see in contemporary Star Wars: villains who "have a point," heroes who do questionable things framed as "realism," and frameworks where the question isn't "will you choose good?" but "what even is good?"

The creators aren't doing this maliciously. They're absorbing the assumptions of prestige television and literary fiction, where moral ambiguity is the marker of seriousness. They're making the kind of content that gets critical acclaim and think pieces. The problem is that this approach saws off the branch the entire franchise sits on.

## The Gritty Reboot Problem

This connects to a broader trend in franchise storytelling: the assumption that "darker" and "grittier" means "more mature."

Consider Zack Snyder's Superman. The Christ imagery remains—cruciform poses, messianic speeches from Jor-El. But the moral content is hollowed out. His Superman is brooding, uncertain, morally conflicted about whether humanity deserves saving. He snaps Zod's neck. The iconography persists, but the substance that gave the iconography meaning has been drained away.

The assumption driving this is that moral clarity equals naivety, and mature storytelling requires ambiguity. But this gets the causality backwards. The original Superman resonated not because audiences in 1978 were simpler—it connected to a deep human hunger for unambiguous good, the same hunger religious traditions addressed for millennia.

The "gritty reboot" treats inherited moral frameworks as embarrassing constraints to subvert rather than load-bearing structures that make stories work. Deconstruction becomes the point rather than a tool in service of something constructive.

You end up with all the aesthetic trappings of myth—capes, lightsabers, epic battles—but none of the metaphysical substance that gave those trappings meaning.

## What the Force Actually Is

The Force is not a magic system. It's not a power source. It's the mythic structure itself made visible.

The Light Side and Dark Side are the moral reality of the Star Wars universe rendered tangible and dramatic. "Use the Force" means trust the good. "The Dark Side" means corruption by fear, anger, hatred. The Jedi path is the path of virtue: patience, self-discipline, compassion. The Sith path is vice given cosmic scope: domination, cruelty, the will to power.

When you start asking "but is the Light Side really better?"—you've stopped making Star Wars. You're making something else with Star Wars costumes.

The answer to "is the Light Side really better?" is: yes, that's the entire premise. That's what the Force *is*. Questioning it doesn't make your story sophisticated. It makes your story confused about what kind of story it is.

This is why the religious roots matter. Lucas wasn't just grabbing cool imagery from Buddhism and Christianity. He was drawing on frameworks that treat moral reality as *real*—as something humans discover, not something humans invent. The Force is what those traditions call the Tao, the Dharma, the Logos, the divine order. It's the structure of reality toward which virtue orients.

Sever that connection and the whole thing collapses into costume drama.

## The Mythic Hunger

Here's what the Disney era misses: audiences still have religious instincts even in a post-religious age.

We still hunger for stories where protecting the innocent is simply good. Where cruelty is simply evil. Where redemption is miraculous rather than therapeutic. Where there is something worth fighting for and something worth fighting against.

We still respond to myth.

The numbers prove it. The Mandalorian Season 1, with its clear moral framework and mythic simplicity, was a genuine cultural phenomenon. Andor, the critical darling built on moral complexity and institutional critique, was respected but didn't penetrate culture the same way. The sequel trilogy, oscillating between deconstruction and hasty reconstruction, left audiences exhausted and divided.

Lucas understood he was making myth. He said so explicitly. He wanted to give new generations what fairy tales and religious narratives had given previous ones—a moral framework, a structure for understanding good and evil, a story that tells you how to live.

The Disney-era creators largely don't see themselves as myth-makers. They see themselves as making prestige television with lightsabers. They import the moral vocabulary of prestige TV—institutional critique, antihero complexity, "gray" characters—without realizing they're importing assumptions that dissolve the foundations of the thing they're making.

Star Wars without the Force—without genuine Light and genuine Dark, without the reality of good and evil, without the mythic structure that plugged into thousands of years of human storytelling—isn't Star Wars. It's content. It might be well-crafted content. But it won't resonate the way the originals did, because it isn't offering what the originals offered.

The solution isn't nostalgia. It isn't memberberries. It isn't bringing back legacy characters or recreating old scenes. It's recovering the cosmology—the understanding that Star Wars is, at root, a religious story, and that's exactly why it works.
