As I glared at my garden, the rocks, the old shade tree
The flowers were thirsty, a branch poked my eye
When I heard a clear echo, of goodness of gaiety
Two sweet singing lovebirds had just now flown by.  

Their laughter and dancing put pause to my aching  
My groaning - this garden that I had to care!  
They sing of the roses, the nest in the making  
They sing of their dreams as they soared through the air.

The spring is now over, the leaves falling streaming  
The love birds are gone now, I know not to where.  
The nest was not built, it stayed in their dreaming  
A treasure they searched for, but never would share.  

The stones in my garden still bother me, trip me  
The flowers still needy, I walk down the path.  
On my lips now a smile, even as the tree hits me  
The love birds song tells me the treasure I have.
