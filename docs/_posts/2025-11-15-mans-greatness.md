In what is found the greatness of man? In his understanding? That would leave the difference between man and beast to be a matter of degree. In fact, that would
leave beast as our superior; for his level of understanding generously bequeaths him with food and shelter and good spirits, whereas for man their attainment,
even in meager measure, is only with much toil and nurture.

Unique to man is not-understanding - the ability to recognize a vastness which is not understood, and to be inspired by that awareness. The beast lives in his
world, which consists entirely of what he perceives. Only man loses himself in the stars.

> Once, in reply to a question asked by my revered grandfather, the Rebbe [Maharash], when he was about seven years old, [his father] the Tzemach Tzedek said: “[It is written that] ‘G‑d made man upright.’ The unique superiority of man that G‑d showed him in His kindness by making him walk upright lies in this — that even though he treads upon the earth, he sees the heavens. A four-legged creature, by contrast, sees only the earth.”
